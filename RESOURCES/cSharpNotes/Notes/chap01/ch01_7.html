<p>
After you have installed the game,
where do its parts exist?
</p>

<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>

<ul>
<li>A program (that controls the action of the game.)
    <ul><li>On the hard disk</li></ul></li>
<li>Data (the images and other information.)
    <ul><li>On the hard disk</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
(When you play the game, its various parts
are copied into and out of main memory.)

<h1>Input and Output Devices</h1>
<A NAME="io devices"></A>
<p>
Input and output devices allow the computer system to
interact with the outside world
by moving data <em>into</em> and <em>out of</em> the system.
An <em>input device</em> is used to
bring data into the system.
Some input devices are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Keyboard</li>
<li>Mouse</li>
<li>Microphone</li>
<li>Bar code reader</li>
<li>Graphics tablet</li>
</ul>

<p>
An <em>output device</em> is used to
send data out of the system.
Some output devices are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Monitor</li>
<li>Printer</li>
<li>Speaker</li>
</ul>


<p>
Input/output devices are usually called I/O devices.
They are directly connected to an electronic module inside
the systems unit called a <b>device controller</b>.
For example,
the speakers of a multimedia computer system are directly
connected to a device controller called an audio card
(such as a Soundblaster),
which in turn is connected to the rest of the system.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes secondary memory devices like the
hard disk are called I/O devices
(because they move data in and out of main memory.)
What counts as an I/O device depends on context.
To a user, an I/O device is something outside of the system box.
To a programmer, 
everything outside of the processor and main memory
looks like an I/O devices.
To an engineer working on the design of a processor,
everything outside of the processor is an I/O device.
