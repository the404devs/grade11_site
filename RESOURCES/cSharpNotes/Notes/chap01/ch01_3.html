<h1>Components of a Computer System</h1>
<p>
Software is <em>stored</em> 
on hardware such as hard disks or tape.
<em>Monsters, Inc.</em> can be recorded on a VCR tape.
But the computer program (and the TV episode)
is  intangible.
It is not the physical storage medium.

The major hardware components of a computer system are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Processor</li>
<li>Main memory</li>
<li>Secondary memory</li>
<li>Input devices</li>
<li>Output devices</li>
</ul>

<p>
You probably have a computer in front of you.
The processor, main memory, and secondary memory devices are
inside the <em>systems unit</em>.
This is the metal box that is sometimes called "the computer."
The monitor <nobr>(the TV-like screen)</nobr> is an output device.
