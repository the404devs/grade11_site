<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
The hard disk.
The hard disk is used for long-term storage of
all software, including the operating system.

<h1>Starting a Program</h1>
<A NAME="starting a program"></A>
<A NAME="booting the OS"></A>
<p>
When a computer is started up, 
the hardware will automatically load
the operating system and start it running.
This process is called <b>booting</b>.
The reason for this odd term is that the
operating system is itself involved in getting
itself running---a process that is like
someone "pulling themselves up by their bootstraps."
Once the operating system is running,
it is used to start up any other program.
</p>

<p>
Here is a (simplified) list of what happens when
the user (you) starts up an application.
Assume that the operating system (OS) is already running.
</p>

<ol>
<li>The user asks to run an application.
    <ul><li>This could be done by clicking on an icon,  
     making a menu choice, or other means.</li></ul></li>
<li>The OS determines the name of the application.</li>
<li>The OS finds the section of the hard disk where the
    application program and its data are stored.</li>
<li>The OS finds an unused section of main memory that
    is large enough for the application.</li>
<li>The OS makes a copy of the application and its data in
    that section of main memory.
    <ul><li>The software on the hard disk is unchanged; 
            a <em>copy</em> of it has been made in main memory</li></ul></li>
<li>The OS sets up resources for the application.</li>
<li>Finally, the OS starts the application running.</li>
</ol>

<p>
As the application runs, the OS is there in the background
managing resources, doing input and output for the application,
and keeping everything else running.

<h3> QUESTION 11:</h3>
<a href="ch01_12.html">
<img src="../nextBut.gif" hspace="5" align="right" border="0"/></a>
<p>
When an application is closed (stops running),
do you think that it is copied from
main memory back to the hard disk?
