<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
Yes--the operating system is running.
Mostly it is managing the user interface,
waiting for some input to tell it what to do.

<h1>Operating Systems</h1>
<A NAME="operating system"></A>

<p>
The operating system is a complex collection of many programs
concerned with keeping the hardware and software components
of a computer system coordinated and functioning.
It is like a shop keeper who keeps a shop in
order by attending to customers,
handling supplier deliveries,
stocking the shelves,
doing the bookkeeping, and so on.
</p>

<p>
The operating system is software;
the same hardware can be used with many different
operating systems (although only one at a time.)
Sometimes the operating system on a computer
becomes corrupted (perhaps because of a computer virus)
and must be tediously re-installed.
Until it is up and running again,
other programs will not be available.
