<h1>Hardware Components </h1>
<p>
The terms "input" and "output" say if data flow into or out of the
systems unit.
The picture shows the major hardware components of a computer system.
The arrows show the direction of data flow.

<A NAME="bus"></A>
<A NAME="controller"></A>
<p>
The <b>bus</b> is a group of wires on the main circuit board
of the computer.
It is a pathway for data flowing between components.
Most devices are connected to the bus through a
<b>controller</b> which coordinates the activities of
the device and the bus.
</p>

<p>
The <b>processor</b> is an electronic device 
about a one inch square,
covered in plastic.
Inside the square is an even smaller square of 
silicon containing millions of  tiny electrical parts.
A processor may contain 100 million transistors.
The processor is the "brain" of the computer system.
It does the fundamental computing within the system, and
directly or indirectly controls all the other components.
</p>

<A NAME="CPU"></A>
<A NAME="chip"></A>
<A NAME="pentium"></A>
<p>
The processor is sometimes called
the <b>Central Processing Unit</b> or <b>CPU</b>.
A particular computer will have a particular type of processor,
such as a Pentium or a SPARC chip.
(processors are often called "chips.")

(It probably looks much like what you are yourself using.)
You might notice that it is 5 years old.
It works fine for running Java programs.
