<h1>Hardware and Software</h1>
<p>
In thinking about <em>Monsters, Inc.</em>,
you are thinking about something conceptual.
It is intangible.
You can't grab it and throw it against a wall,
or break it in half,
or weight it on a scale.
It does not have a physical existence.
</p>

<p>
You might record <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> on a VCR tape.
The tape is physical, but the movie is conceptual.
When you speak of the movie,
you usually mean the conceptual movie, 
not a particular tape that has a record of it. 
Sometimes the phrase "intellectual material" is used
for movies, TV programs,
novels, music, and computer programs.
Sometimes the word "software" is used for the same
purpose, although usually "software" refers to
computer programs and data.
</p>

<p>
The TV set you used to watch <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> 
is tangible.
It has a physical existence.
You can weigh it on a scale,
you can throw it against a wall,
you can break it in half,
you can pound it to pieces with a hammer
(and your grades will improve if you do).
</p>

<p>
TV sets are useful because  they combine the
tangible (the TV set itself) and the intangible (TV programs).
Computer systems are useful in the same way--they
combine  tangible components called
<em>hardware</em> and conceptual components called <em>software</em>.

Imagine that you have  a copy of Mark Twain's "Tom Sawyer".
You tear it to pieces and push the shreds
through your garbage disposal.
Have you destroyed "Tom Sawyer"?
