<h1>Types of Programs</h1>

<A NAME="systems program"></A>

<p>
There are two categories of programs.
<b>Application</b> programs (usually called just "applications")
are programs that people use to get their work done.
Computers exist because people want to run these programs.
<b>Systems</b> programs keep all the hardware
and software  running together smoothly.
The difference between "application program" 
and "system program" is fuzzy.
Often it is more a matter of marketing than of logic.

<p>
The most important systems program is the <b>operating system</b>.
The operating system is always present when the computer is running.
It coordinates the operation of all the hardware and software components
of the computer system.
The operating system is responsible for starting application programs
running and finding the resources that they need.
When an application program is running,
the operating system manages the details of the hardware for it.
For example, when you type characters on the keyboard, the operating
system determines which application program they are intended for and 
does the work of getting them there.
</p>

<p>
Modern operating systems usually come with a <b>user interface</b>
that enables users to easily interact with application programs
(and with the operating system itself) by using windows, buttons,
menus, icons, the mouse, and the keyboard.
Examples of operating systems are Unix, Windows 98, Windows NT,
Linux, Solaris, and System 7.
