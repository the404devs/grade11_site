<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Where (in the computer system) is the program you are running?
    <ul><li><span style="color:blue;">In main memory.</span> 
    (A permanent copy will also be in secondary memory--the hard disk).</li></ul></li>
<li>Where are the characters you have typed?
    <ul><li><span style="color:blue;">In main memory.</span> (When you "save" your document, 
    they will be copied to a file on the hard disk.)</li></ul></li>

<h1>Secondary Memory</h1>
<A NAME="hard disk"></A>
<A NAME="filek"></A>
<p>
Secondary memory is where programs and data are kept on a long-term basis.
Common secondary storage devices are the hard disk and floppy disks.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The hard disk has enormous storage capacity compared to main memory.</li>
<li>The hard disk is usually contained in the systems unit of a computer.</li>
<li>The hard disk is used for long-term storage of programs and data.</li>
<li>Data and programs on the hard disk are organized into <b>files</b>--named
    sections of the disk.</li>
</ul>

<A NAME="gigabyte"></A>
<p>
A hard disk might have a storage capacity of 40 gigabytes.
This is about 300 times the amount of storage in main memory
(assuming 128 megabytes of main memory.)
However,
a hard disk is very slow compared to main memory.
The reason for having two types of storage is this contrast:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Primary memory</th><th>Secondary memory</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
    <ol>
    <li>Fast</li>
    <li>Expensive</li>
    <li>Low capacity</li>
    <li>Connects directly to the processor</li>
    </ol>
</td>

<td>
    <ol>
    <li>Slow</li>
    <li>Cheap</li>
    <li>Large capacity</li>
    <li>Not connected directly to the processor</li>
    </ol>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<A NAME="floppy disk"></A>
<p>
Floppy disks are mostly used for transferring 
software between
computer systems 
and for casual backup of software.
They have low capacity, and are very, very slow
compared to other storage devices.

</p>

<ul>
<li>A program (that controls the action of the game.)</li>
<li>Data (the images and other information.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
After you have installed the game,
where does each of these things exist in the computer system?
