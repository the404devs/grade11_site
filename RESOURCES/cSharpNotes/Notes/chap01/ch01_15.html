<h1>Hyperlinks</h1>
<A NAME="hyperlink"></A>
<p>
One Web page is connected to another with a
<b>hyperlink</b>.
If you have been reading these notes over the Web,
you have been linking between Web pages by using
hyperlinks.
</p>

<A NAME="web browser"></A>
<p>
A web browser (such as Netscape Navigator) usually displays
a hyperlink in a distinguishing color (usually blue.)
When you click on it,
the browser asks the operating system of the computer to
get a particular Web page from another computer connected to the Internet.
The Web page to get is specified with a <b>uniform resource locator</b> URL.
A URL specifies both the computer (among all the Internet computers in the
world) and the exact Web page on that computer.
</p>

<p>
To see some examples of URLs, 
keep watching the box in your browser
labeled "Location:"
