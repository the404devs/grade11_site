<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
A high level language.
Programmers can create programs 
in much less time (costing much less money) by using a high level language.

<p>
Programers create programs by writing commands in a high level language.
A high level language program consists of lines of text that have been
created with a text editor and are kept in a file on the hard disk.
For example,
here is a complete program in "C" (Java will be discussed later):
</p>


<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
main()
{
  int sum = 0;
  sum = 2 + 2;
  printf( "%d\n", sum );
}
</pre>


<p>
This program could be saved on the hard disk in a file called <code>addup.c</code>.
Like all files,
it consists of a sequence of bytes.
Since it is a text file, these bytes contain character data.
You can edit the file with a text editor and print the file on a printer.
It <em>does not</em> contain machine instructions.
If the bytes are copied into main memory, they cannot run as a program
without some extra work being done.
</p>

<blockquote>
A <code>source program</code> (or source file) is a text file that contains
instructions written in a high level language.
It can not be executed (made to run) by a processor without some intermediate
steps.
</blockquote>
 

<A NAME="program translation"></A>
<p>
Usually a source program is <b>translated</b> into a machine language program
An application program called a <b>translater</b> takes a source file as input
and produces an executable program (machine language program) as output.
For example,
the "C" program <code>addup.c</code> could be translated into an executable program.
The executable program might be called <code>addup.exe</code> and can be saved on the
hard disk.
Now the executable version of the program can be copied into main memory and executed.
</p>

<A NAME="compile"></A>
<p>
The word <b>compile</b> means the same thing as <b>translate</b>.
So one can say that a source program is compiled into an executable program.

<h3> QUESTION 9:</h3>
<a href="ch04_10.html">
<img src="../nextBut.gif" hspace="5" align="right" border="0"/></a>
<p>
Say that a source program has been translated into an executable.
The executable has been run a few times, and the programer 
decides to make a change to the program.
Where is the change made? To the source program or to the executable program?
