<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
I would guess about 100,000 operations.
Certainly not as few as 100 or less.
All these small opertions add up to a useful
big operation: displaying a new Web page.

<h1>Machine Instructions</h1>
<A NAME="machine instruction"></A>
<A NAME="machine operation"></A>
<p>
Users and programmers of computers usually don't think about
the millions of tiny electronic operations that go on each second.
The situation is (very roughly) similar to when you are
driving your car.
You think about the "big operations" it can perform,
such as "accelerate", "turn left", "brake", and so on.
You don't think about  the valves in your engine
opening and closing 24,000 times per minute.
</p>

<p>
Each tiny electronic operations 
that a processor can perform is called a
<b>machine operation</b>.
A processor (a "machine") performs these one at a time,
but millions of them in a second.
</p>

<A NAME="program, executable"></A>
<p>
A <b>machine instruction</b> consists of several bytes
in   memory that tells the processor to perform one
machine operation.
The processor looks at machine instructions in main memory
one after another, and performs one machine operation for each
machine instruction.
The collection of machine instructions in main memory is called a
<b>machine language program</b>
or (more commonly) an <b>executable program</b>.
</p>

<p>
Don't panic if the above seems incomprehensible.
It takes some getting used to.
(And to <em>really</em> understand it all takes several courses.)
