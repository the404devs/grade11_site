<h1>Machine Language Program</h1>
<p>
There are at least two sensible programs for the toothbrush.
Here is one of them:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border cellpadding=4  bgcolor="white" bordercolor="brown">
<tr bgcolor="tan"><th>Address</th><th>Machine Instruction</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>&nbsp;0000 0001 </td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>&nbsp;0000 0010 </td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>&nbsp;0000 1000 </td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>&nbsp;0000 0100 </td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>&nbsp;0000 0000 </td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
To help you read the program,
here is the list of machine operations:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border cellpadding=4 bgcolor="white" bordercolor="brown">
<tr bgcolor="tan"><th>Machine Instruction</th><th>Machine Operation</th></tr>
<tr><td>0000 0000</td><td>Stop</td></tr>
<tr><td>0000 0001</td><td>Rotate bristles left</td></tr>
<tr><td>0000 0010</td><td>Rotate bristles right</td></tr>
<tr><td>0000 0100</td><td>Go back to start of program</td></tr>
<tr><td>0000 1000</td><td>Skip next instruction if switch is off</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>


<p>
This is,
of course,
a stupid example.
Electric toothbrushes are not controlled by computer processors.
And, the machine instructions of actual processors are much more detailed.
But the essential ideas of the example are these:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A machine language program is a sequence of machine language instructions in main memory.
<li>A machine instruction consists of one or more bytes (in the example, only one.)
<li>The processor runs a program one machine instruction at a time.
<li>All the little machine operations add up to something useful.
</ul>

<p>
If toothbrush user leaves the switch "on" for
a while,
the program repeats its operations many times.
This is how most programs in real computers run--many little
operations add up to a useful function, which is then
repeated many times.

<h3> QUESTION 5:</h3>
<a href="ch04_6.html">
<img src="../nextBut.gif" hspace="5" align="right" border="0"/></a>
<p>
Will the electric toothbruch stop immediately when the switch is turned off?
(Follow through the program to see if this happens.)
