<h1>Speed</h1>
<p>
The situation with computer languages is somewhat like that with human
languages:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Translator:</b> &nbsp; takes a complete document in one language and creates
    a complete document in another language, which can then be used at any time.</li>
<li><b>Interpreter:</b> &nbsp; acts as an intermediate between a speaker of one
    language and a speaker of another language to make it look like both speakers
    are talking directly to each other.</li>
</ul> 


<p>
Using a human interpreter as an intermediate is slower than 
conversing directly in a particular language.
The same is true with computer language interpreters.
The interpreter has to do quite a bit of work to deal with
the language it is interpreting.
The extra work makes it look like the virtual processor is
much slower than the real one.
