<h1>Web Pages in the same Directory</h1>
<p>
A full <b>URL</b> (Uniform Resource Locator) is needed when a page
links to another one that is on a different computer.
Often pages link to others that are in the same directory.
In that case, using just the file name of the linked-to page will work:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;a href="PageB.html"&gt;Words that the user sees&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>

<p>
A Web browser shows the  "Words that the user sees" underlined and in blue
(depending on the preferences setting of the browser.)
The user clicks on them to go to the linked-to page.
</p>

<p>
Hyperlinks go practically anywhere in your Web page.
The following shows a link that is part of a paragraph:
</p>

<script language="JavaScript">
function seeItClick( text ) 
{
  var wopts = ""   // window options

  // Build the window options
  wopts += "toolbar=no,"
  wopts += "location=no,"
  wopts += "directories=no,"
  wopts += "status=yes,"
  wopts += "menubar=no,"
  wopts += "scrollbars=yes,"
  wopts += "resizable=yes,"
  wopts += "copyhistory=yes"
  wopts += "width=400,height=200"

  win = window.open( "",  "YourHtml",  wopts)
  win.document.open()
  win.document.write( text )
  win.defaultStatus = "Click the close button to exit."
  win.document.close()
}
</script>

<form name="aForm">
<center>

<textarea name="htmlArea" rows="15" cols="70" wrap="physical">
<html>
<head><title>Hyperlink Demo</title></head>

<body>
<div align="center">
<h1>Hyperlink Demo</h1>
</div>

<p>
Hyperlinks can be placed in the middle of
a paragraph, in lists, in tables, and in
many other places.
Often the words inside the tag are
made part of a sentence.
For example,
Click <a href="PageB.html"> on this link </a> to go
to <b>PageB</b>.
</p>

<p>
The above link assumes that there is 
a file <code>PageB.html</code>
on <u>your</u> local hard disk.
Since there probably isn't,
it probably won't work.
You will see an error "alert"
instead.
</p>

</body>
</html>

</textarea>
</center>
<br clear="all"/>

<p>
You can click &nbsp;
<input type="button" 
  name="seeItButton" 
  value="Here" 
  onClick="seeItClick(document.aForm.htmlArea.value)">
to see what the HTML does.
But when you click on the link inside that window,
it will probably not work
(because it tries to link to a page on your hard disk
that does not exist.)
</p>
</form>

<a href="htmlPart2_9.html">

<p>
Play with the above Web page:
Change the text of the anchor tag from
"on this link" to some other words.

What is shown in the bar at the bottom of the browser window
when you move the mouse pointer over a hyperlink
such as the one below?
