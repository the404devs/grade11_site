In the current standard, the tags are lower case.
But browsers usually let you use upper case.

<h1>Web Pages as Text Files</h1>
<p>
The example Web pages such as the one below 
never become files on your hard disk.
On your computer they exist 
only in the main memory being used by the browser.
As a security feature,
browsers do not read or write files to your hard disk
unless you ask it to.
Use <code>File/Save As</code> in the menu bar.
Or you can copy text from any Web page into Notepad and
save the text to a disk file:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Start Notepad (or other text editor).</li>
<li>Put the mouse at the top of the example (in the text box), hold the
    left mouse button down, and drag to the bottom of the example.</li>
<li>The text you want should be highlighted.</li>
<li>Click "Edit/Copy" in the browser menu to copy the text to the clipboard.</li>
<li>In Notepad, click "Edit/Paste" to paste from the clipboard to the editor.</li>
<li>Now (in Notepad) click "File/Save as" to save to a disk file.</li>
<li>Give the disk file  a name that ends in the extension <em>.htm</em> or
    <em>.html</em></li>
</ol>

<p>
Once you have done this, you can look at the file with your browser 
(navigate to it using <code>File/open</code> or <code>File/open page</code> from the menu)
or click on it in Windows explorer.
</p>

The matter is a perfectly trivial one" &#8212; he jerked
