<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
No &#8212; even though both <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> may be set with the
same type the tags do not match.
All the text starting with the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> will come out emphasised.

<h1>Font Families</h1>
<p>
Often Web pages do not pick the particular font family
that the browser uses.
For example, unless otherwise specified,
most browsers  use the "Times Roman" family of fonts.
However,  the user (you) can set the preferences otherwise,
and a file called a "style sheet" can also specify particular fonts.
Or you can change the size of the fonts used to display a page
(look at the "View" menu option of your browser.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> If you have not done so, find the preferences menu of
your browser and change the default fonts. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>In Navigator, go to Edit/Preferences/Appearance/Fonts</li>
<li>In Explorer, go to View/Internet Options/General/Fonts</li>
</ul>

<p>
Your best choice for
"variable width font" ("proportional font") is a <em>sans serif</em> font
such as <em>Comic Sans MS</em> or <em>Helvetica</em>.
With a  sans serif font characters do not have the little extra
bits ("serifs") at their ends.
</p>

<img src="serifEg.gif" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20" />

<p>
The illustration shows fonts with and without serifs.
Serifs improve ease of reading in printed text,
but with bit-mapped graphics (graphics made up of little
dots, such as on your monitor) serifs do not come out as well
and make reading more difficult.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes a Web author wants to use a particular font no
matter what the user's preferences.
A trick for doing this is to include the text as
an image file.
That is what was done here..

<h3> QUESTION 16:</h3>
<a href="htmlPart1_17.html">
<img src="../nextBut.gif" hspace="5" align="right" border="0"/></a>
<p>
Why is it a bad idea to make all text an image file so a
Web author has exact control over what the browser displays?
