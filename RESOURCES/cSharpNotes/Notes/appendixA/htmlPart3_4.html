<h1>Host and Client Computers</h1>
<p>
The applet bytecode and the Web page are both located on
a hard disk of a host computer.
</p>

<p>
Of course, when your browser asks for them,
a <em>copy</em> of the Web page and a <em>copy</em> of
the bytecodes are transmitted 
over the Internet
to the main memory of your computer.
Your browser now formats a nice picture
of the Web page and runs the bytecodes
using its version of the Java Virtual Machine.
</p>

<p>
This is a slightly weird idea.
Just 10 years ago it would have been unthinkable
in all but the most advanced university computer
science departments.
Here is a picture:

<p>
The browser on the client (your home computer) 
uses information in its main memory,
that has been copied from the host's hard disk.
It is as if the whole Internet works as
your computer's secondary storage.

<p>
Could many different home (client) computers
simultaneously be showing the Web page and
running the applet?
