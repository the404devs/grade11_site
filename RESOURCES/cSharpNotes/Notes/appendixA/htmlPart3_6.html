If it didn't work it might be that your browser does not
have Java applets enabled.
To enable applets in Netscape Navigator,
go to <code>Edit/Preferences/Advanced</code>
and check that applets are enabled.
In Microsoft's Internet Explorer go to
go to <code>View/Internet Options/Advanced</code>.

<form>
<p>
If you are working at a computer furnished by a
company or university, or are behind a firewall,
applets may have been permanently disabled.
In this case there is nothing you can do.
&nbsp;<input type="button" name="but1" value="Firewall?"
onClick="alert('A firewall is a computer that stands between all other computers in a company and the Internet.  The firewall examines all Internet transmissions and suppresses those thought to pose a security risk.')">

Old browsers do not support Java.
Some browsers only support older versions of Java.
If your browser is more than a few years old,
get a newer one.
