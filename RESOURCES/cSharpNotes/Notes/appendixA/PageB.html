If you downloaded and unzipped these lessons,
then this <code>PageB.html</code>
was put in the same disk directory as
the HTML lessons.
So, the link to it <u>does</u> work.
</p>

<p>
But if you are reading the lessons over 
the web, then it doesn't work.

Click on the "close button" to get rid
of this window.
<b>Or</b>, click <a HREF="htmlPart2_8.html"> here </a> to get totally confused
(not always a bad thing.)
