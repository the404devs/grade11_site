<h1><b><code>align</code></b> and <b><code>cellpadding</code></b></h1>

<table border="border" align="right" cellpadding="5" hspace="10">
<tr> <th>Monarch</th>     <th>Reign</th> </tr>
<tr> <td>William I</td>   <td>1066-1087</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>William II</td>  <td>1087-1100</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Henry I</td>     <td>1100-1135</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Stephen</td>     <td>1135-1154</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
As with images, it is possible to position 
a table to one side of page and have text 
fill the remaining space.
Do this with the <nobr><code><b>align="right"</b></code></nobr>
(as with images) attribute inside the table tag.
Of course, you can align the table to the left, as well.
</p>

<p>
Another useful attribute to include inside the table tag
is <nobr><code><b>cellpadding="5"</b></code></nobr>.
This places 5 pixels of padding around each data item
in the table.
This was done with the table at right.
</p>

<p>
Also, as with images, put space between the table and
the surrounding text using <nobr><code><b>hspace="10"</b></code></nobr>
and <nobr><code><b>vspace="10"</b></code></nobr> (use whatever values you want).
</p>

<p>
In the following table, experiment with different values for
these  attributes:
</p>

<script language="JavaScript">
function seeItClick( text ) 
{
  var wopts = ""   // window options

  // Build the window options
  wopts += "toolbar=yes,"
  wopts += "location=no,"
  wopts += "directories=no,"
  wopts += "status=yes,"
  wopts += "menubar=yes,"
  wopts += "scrollbars=yes,"
  wopts += "resizable=yes,"
  wopts += "copyhistory=yes"
  wopts += "width=600,height=400"

  win = window.open( "",  "YourHtml",  wopts)
  win.document.open()
  win.document.write( text )
  win.defaultStatus = "Click the close button to exit."
  win.document.close()
}
</script>

<form name="aForm">
<center>

<textarea name="htmlArea" rows="20" cols="70" wrap="physical">
<html>
<head><title>More Table Attributes</title></head>

<body>
<div align="center"><h1>More Table Attributes</h1></div>

<table border align="" cellpadding="" hspace="" vspace="">
    <tr> <th>Monarch</th>     <th>Reign</th> </tr>
    <tr> <td>William I</td>   <td>1066-1087</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>William II</td>  <td>1087-1100</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>Henry I</td>     <td>1100-1135</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>Stephen</td>     <td>1135-1154</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
Pick "left" , "right" or "center" for the
<code>align</code> attribute.
Fill in an integer value for the other attributes.
Click the button to see the result.
This may seem to be getting complicated.
It is, a little.
But it is certainly much easier than
doing it on a typewritter.
</p>

<p>
In ancient times,
before the PC,
high school women spent hours and hours
learning how to use typewriters to
produce business letters.
Men, of course, did important things.
They spent hours and hours 
learning how to set metal type 
for printing presses.
</p>

<p>
<em>My</em> high school
was very modern.
The men took typing class and the women
learned printing.
</p>

<p>
Oddly,
the men who took typing 
benefitted enormously.
Typing is now a necessary skill for high-tech.
The women who took
print shop did not fair as well.
