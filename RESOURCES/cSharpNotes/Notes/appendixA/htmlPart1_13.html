<h1>Blockquote</h1>
<p>
Often in printed material a paragraph is indented on both sides to show
that is is quoted from another source, or to give special emphasis to
its contents.
</p>

<blockquote>
Blockquotes such as this one can be effective, but using too many of
them in a Web page makes it look disorganized.
A blockquote is enclosed in the tags 
<code><b>&lt;blockquote&gt;</b></code> and <code><b>&lt;/blockquote&gt;.</b></code>
Be careful not to forget the closing tag.
</blockquote>

<p>
In the following, make the second paragraph a blockquote.
To do so, replace the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> with 
<code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code>.

<h1>The Adventure of the Blockquote</h1>

<p>
I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my
hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp
frost had set in, and the windows were thick
with the ice crystals.

<p>
"I suppose," I remarded,
"that, homely as it looks, this thing has some
deadly story linked on to it &#8213; that it
is the clue which will guide you in the solution
of some mystery and the punishment of some crime."
