<h1>Images in Web Pages</h1>
<p>
As are all Internet resources, a digital image is a collection of bit
patterns stored as a disk file.
So the fundamental electronics and communications is the same for
images as for any other resource.
To include an image in a Web page use the <b><code>img</code></b> tag:
</p>

<pre class="code">
<code>&lt;img src="petrock.jpg" /&gt;</code>
</pre>

<p>
<b><code>img</code></b> is the HTML tag type; <b><code>src</code></b>
stands for "source" and is followed by the relative pathname to the image
or the full URL of the image.
For example, the above tag will cause this image to be loaded:
</p>
<img src="petrock.jpg" />

<p>
The slash "/" at the end is officially required by XHTML in order
to follow the rule that all tags have a closing tag.
But instead of two tags 
<code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/img&gt;</code>
use one combined tag <code>&lt;img /&gt;</code>.
For compatibility with older browser put 
a space in front of the slash,
although usually this does not matter.
</p>

<p>
Image files follow particular formats,
and use various schemes to compress their data.
Only three types of image files can be used in Web pages:
"gif" files, "jpg" files,  and "png" files.
These types of image files are used by most image processing
programs.
Some high-end commercial programs (like Adobe Photoshop)
use specialized formats, but can save a version of the image
in one of the above formats.
