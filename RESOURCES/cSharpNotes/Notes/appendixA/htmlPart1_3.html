<h1>Markup Language</h1>
<p>
A Web page consists of two things:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The <b>content</b>---the text (and other things) you want the viewer to see, and</li>
<li>HTML <b>tags</b> that describe the functional role of each part of the content.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This is the idea of a
<b>markup language</b>:
a markup language describes the functional roles
of various sections of content
but leaves the
exact layout up to the Web browser.
</p>

<p>
This is how things were done in ancient times (pre computer.)
An author would create the content (possibly in handwritting),
a publisher would mark up the text with symbols showing how it was
to be formatted,
and a printer would follow the instructions in setting the type.
<em>Content creation</em> was a separate task from <em>document design</em>.
</p>

<p>
The advantage of using functional markup is that 
different browsers on different types of computers can format
the content as is best for them (and as their users have chosen.)
The same Web page can (ideally) be viewed by any browser on any computer.
