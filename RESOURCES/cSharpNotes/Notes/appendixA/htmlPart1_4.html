<h1>Small Web Page</h1>
<p>
You know what a paragraph is, of course.
Notice that the definition
describes the functional role of a paragraph but does not describe
how a paragraph is displayed.
In HTML a paragraph is placed between these two tags: 
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;p&gt;  
<em>paragraph goes here</em>
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<p>
To be compatible with HTML version 4.0 use small letter "p".
Most browsers will also let you use a capital "P" but this is a deprecated feature.
You don't have to start the tag in column one.
Here is a small Web page containing a single paragraph (and some other necessary
tags which we will get to in a moment):
</p>

<script language="JavaScript">

//
// Create a window ...
//
function seeItClick( text ) 
{

  var wopts = ""   // window options


  // Build the window options
  wopts += "toolbar=no,"
  wopts += "location=no,"
  wopts += "directories=no,"
  wopts += "status=yes,"
  wopts += "menubar=no,"
  wopts += "scrollbars=no,"
  wopts += "resizable=yes,"
  wopts += "copyhistory=yes"
  wopts += "width=400,height=200"

  //
  // Create the document
  //
  // Create the window and write the document
  // into it.

  win = window.open( "",  "YourHtml",  wopts)
  win.document.open()
  win.document.write( text )
  win.defaultStatus = " Click the close button to exit. " 
  win.document.close()

}


</SCRIPT>

<form name="aForm">
<center>

<textarea name="htmlArea" rows="10" cols="70" wrap="physical">
<html><head></head><body>

<p>
Here is a paragraph.         Click you mouse inside
of it and add
some text of your own,   if you
want.       Notice how the browser  ignores extra
spaces and end-of-lines
when it formats the paragraph.           </p>

</body></html>

</textarea>
</center>

<p>
Now click
<input type="button" 
  name="seeItButton" 
  value="Here" 
  onClick="seeItClick(document.aForm.htmlArea.value)">
to see what this HTML does.
</p>

<p>
A new browser window
will appear with your HTML inside.
To exit the window, click on its 'close' button.
(Unfortunately, this does not work with all browsers.
If it does not work with yours try a different browser;
perhaps IE 4.0 or higher).
</p>
</form>
</center>

<div class="question">
<h3> QUESTION 4:</h3>
<a href="htmlPart1_5.html">
<img src="../nextBut.gif" hspace="5" align="right" border="0"/></a>
<p>
Add another paragraph to this Web page.
(Just click after the &lt;/p&gt; and start typing.)

Don't forget the &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; tags.
(If you forget these tags, things will probably work OK,
but practice doing things right.)
