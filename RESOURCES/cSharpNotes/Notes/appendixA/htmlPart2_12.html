<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
No.  The route to take depends on the current patterns of
traffic.  Just like the path a letter takes through the
Postal system depends on current conditions.

<div class="lesson">
<h1>HTTP</h1>
<p>
You may recall  the advantages of binary representation.
Without these advantages, the Web would not be possible.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Binary devices are simple and easy to build. </li>
<li>Binary signals are unambiguous (hence immune to noise).  </li>
<li>Binary patterns can be copied flawlessly. </li> 
<li>Anything that can be represented with any sort of 
    pattern can be represented with patterns of bits. </li> 
</ol>

<p>
The last advantage means that every resource 
is really a collection of bits.
Usually these bits are stored in a file on a hard disk.
So a URL must specify: a particular computer
and a particular disk file on that computer.
A URL must also specify  how the
bits are packaged when they are transmitted.
This is called the <b>protocol</b>.
For most Web resources the protocol is
<b>HTTP</b> (HyperText Transfer Protocol).
You do not need to know the details of HTTP.
</p>

<p>
A non-electronic example of a protocol is the set of rules
from the US Post Office that says what size envelopes are
expected, where to put the address, where to put the
return address, 
and where to put the stamp.
Similar rules are needed for digital communication.

<h3> QUESTION 12:</h3>
<a href="htmlPart2_13.html">
<img src="../nextBut.gif" hspace="5" align="right" border="0"/></a>
<form>
<p>
(Thought Question: ) The Internet uses different protocols for different
applications.
Think of an Internet application that is likely to use a different
protocol than that for Web page transmission.
