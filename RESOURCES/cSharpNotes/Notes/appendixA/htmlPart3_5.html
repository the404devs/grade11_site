<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
Yes&#8212;because each home computer has a copy of
the data and bytecodes.

<h1>Location of Bytecodes</h1>

<p>
Often the applet bytecodes are located in the same
directory as the Web page (the text file.)
But the code can be anywhere on the Web.
If the applet is somewhere else on the Web,
the <code>code=""</code> will still name the bytecode file.
But now the applet tag must include <code>codebase="<em>some URL</em>"</code> to point to
the directory where the code is contained.
Don't name the bytecode file in the codebase! 
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;applet code="ExampleApplet.class" 
codebase="http://chortle.ccsu.ctstateu.edu/cs151/Notes/appendixA"
width="250" height="200"&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Add the applet tags (above) to the following Web page.
This will only work if you are connected to the Web.
If you have FTPed and unzipped these notes onto your own
computer, you may optionally omit the <code>codebase</code> part of the tag
(because a copy of the applet will be on your hard disk,
unless I forgot to put it in the zip file.)
</p>

<script language="JavaScript">
function seeItClick( text ) 
{
  var wopts = ""   // window options

  // Build the window options
  wopts += "toolbar=yes,"
  wopts += "location=no,"
  wopts += "directories=no,"
  wopts += "status=yes,"
  wopts += "menubar=yes,"
  wopts += "scrollbars=yes,"
  wopts += "resizable=yes,"
  wopts += "copyhistory=yes"
  wopts += "width=600,height=400"

  win = window.open( "",  "YourHtml",  wopts)
  win.document.open()
  win.document.write( text )
  win.defaultStatus = " Click the close button to exit. "
  win.document.close()
}
</script>

<form name="aForm">

<textarea name="htmlArea" rows="20" cols="70" wrap="physical">

<head><title>Applet in a Web Page</title></head>

<body>
<div align="center"><h1>Applet in a Web Page</h1></div>

<p>
The following applet is nothing more than another 
boring "hello world" applet.
If you are presently connected to the Internet,
click on this link:
</p>

</body>
</html>

</textarea>
</center>
<p>
Add the applet tags, then click
<INPUT TYPE="button" 
  name="seeItButton" 
  value="Here" 
  onClick="seeItClick(document.aForm.htmlArea.value)">
to see what the HTML does.
</p>
</FORM>


<p>
There is a fairly good chance that this will work.
At least, <em>I</em> am amazed when things like this work.
When working with applets at home, it is easiest to keep
them in the same directory as the Web page.</p>
