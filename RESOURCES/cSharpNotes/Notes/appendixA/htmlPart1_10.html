<h1>Centering Text</h1>
<p>
Some browsers center important headings; others do not.
Strictly speaking, whether a heading is centered or not
is a formatting decision and  should be left to the browser.
The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> ... <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code> tags describe the <em>function</em>
of the text they contain.
However, Web authors like to have some control over the
presentation of their content.
</p>

<p>
To center a heading or a paragraph (or anything else) use these tags:
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;div align="center"&gt; <em>stuff to be centered</em> &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>


<p>
<b>div</b> stands for "division".
The <code>align="center"</code> describes what type of division you want.
You can also have <code>align="right"</code> and <code>align="left"</code>.
</p>

<p>
Here is a Web page.
Insert some <code>div</code> tags to center the heading and the second paragraph.
(Remember that you can use "copy", "cut", and "paste" from the
edit menu of your browser with the text in the box.)
</p>

<script language="JavaScript">
function seeItClick( text ) 
{

  var wopts = ""   // window options

  // Build the window options
  wopts += "toolbar=no,"
  wopts += "location=no,"
  wopts += "directories=no,"
  wopts += "status=yes,"
  wopts += "menubar=no,"
  wopts += "scrollbars=no,"
  wopts += "resizable=yes,"
  wopts += "copyhistory=yes"
  wopts += "width=400,height=200"

  //
  // Create the document
  //
  // Create the window and write the document
  // into it.

  win = window.open( "",  "YourHtml",  wopts)
  win.document.open()
  win.document.write( text )
  win.defaultStatus = "Click the close button to exit."
  win.document.close()

}

<h1>The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle</h1>
<p>
I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon
the second morning after Christmas, with the intention
of wishing him the compliments of the season.
</p>

<p>
He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple 
dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon 
the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, 
evidently newly studied, near at hand.
</p>

<p>
Beside the couch was a wooden chair,
and on the angle of the back hung a
very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat,
much the worse for wear, and cracked
in several places.  A lens and a forcepts
lying upon the seat of the chair suggested 
that the hat had been suspended in this
manner for the purpose of examination.

Then click
<INPUT TYPE="button" 
  name="seeItButton" 
  value="Here" 
  onClick="seeItClick(document.aForm.htmlArea.value)">
to see what this HTML does.
Then change it as suggested and click again.

<p>
Try <code>align="left"</code> and <code>align="right"</code>
with the second paragraph.
The ending tag is  <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code>
for all versions of the <code>div</code> tag.
