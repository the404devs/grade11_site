<h1>Additional IMG Tag Attributes</h1>
<p>
One way to center an image is to bracket it with the <b>div</b> tag like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="petrock.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>
If you want the image to be positioned to the left of the page and 
for text
to fill the area to the right of it,
use the <b><code>align</code></b> attribute within the <code>img</code> tag.
The img tag should be followed by the text that will fill the
area not used by the image:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;img src="petrock.jpg" align="left" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This text will appear to the right of the
image.
It may look a bit cramped.
We will get to that in a bit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You may have as many paragraphs here as you want.
After the area to the right of the image is filled,
the rest of the words will
fill the full width of the page,
as usual.
</pre>

Here is what the above does on your browser:
</p>

<img src="petrock.jpg" align="left" />
<P>
This text will appear to the right of the
image.
It may look a bit cramped.
We will get to that in a bit.
</p>

<P>
You may have as many paragraphs here as you want.
After the area to the right of the image is filled,
the rest of the words will
fill the full width of the page,
as usual.
</p>

<br clear="all" />
<br />
<p>
After the last paragraph it is often
useful to include the tag
&lt;br clear="all" /&gt;.
This says to stop filling the area to the right
of the image and to resume using the full page for text.
<br clear="all" />
<br />

<h3> QUESTION 8:</h3>
<a href="htmlPart3_9.html">

<p>
How would you write a tag that puts the image on the <b>right</b> and
text to the <b>left</b> of it?
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;img src="petrock.jpg" align="<span style="color:blue">__________</span> /"&gt;
