<h1>Practice with Headings</h1>
<p>
Usually an author tries to have just a few level 1 headings,
and divides the text between level 1 headings with level 2 headings.
Long documents might use more levels of headings.
For example, a book-length document would use level 1 headings
for chapter titles, level 2 headings for the main sections within a
chapter, and perhaps level 3 headings for fine divisions of a section.
</p>

<p>
Here is a Web page with some headings in it.
Click on the button to see how your browser displays them.
Change the level of some of the headings to see what happens.
</p>

<script language="JavaScript">

//
// Create a window ...
//
function seeItClick( text ) 
{

  var wopts = ""   // window options

  // Build the window options
  wopts += "toolbar=no,"
  wopts += "location=no,"
  wopts += "directories=no,"
  wopts += "status=yes,"
  wopts += "menubar=no,"
  wopts += "scrollbars=no,"
  wopts += "resizable=yes,"
  wopts += "copyhistory=yes"
  wopts += "width=400,height=200"

  //
  // Create the document
  //
  // Create the window and write the document
  // into it.

  win = window.open( "",  "YourHtml",  wopts)
  win.document.open()
  win.document.write( text )
  win.defaultStatus = "Click the close button to exit."
  win.document.close()

<h1>Important Heading</h1>
<p>
I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon
the second morning after Christmas, with the intention
of wishing him the compliments of the season.
</p>

<h2>Less Important Heading</h2>
<p>
He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple 
dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon 
the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, 
evidently newly studied, near at hand.
</p>

<h6>Least Important Heading</h6>
<p>
Beside the couch was a wooden chair,
and on the angle of the back hung a
very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat,
much the worse for wear, and cracked
in several places.  A lens and a forcepts
lying upon the seat of the chair suggested 
that the hat had been suspended in this
manner for the purpose of examination.

<li>Remove the ending <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code> tag and observe the effect.</li>
<li>Change the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags to a level that does not exist (such as 7).</li>
