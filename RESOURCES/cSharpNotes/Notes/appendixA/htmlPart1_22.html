<h1>End of Part I</h1>
<p>
You have reached the end of this section of the appendix.
If you want, you can go back to some of the sample
Web pages and experiment,
or try creating a Web page from scratch with
Notepad.
</p>

<p>
Another useful thing to do is to look at the HTML behind
some Web pages (use View/Source)
and see how much you can figure out.
