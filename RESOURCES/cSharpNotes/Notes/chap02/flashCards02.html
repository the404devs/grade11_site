<!--  INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAKING YOUR OWN FLASH CARDS:
<p>
1.  Modify this file with a text editor, such as Notepad.

2.  Each card consists of a questions[] answers[] pair.
 
3.  The cards are numbered from 0 to N-1.

4.  For each questions[] line, enter a question between the quote marks 
      (replacing what is already there.)  Keep everything on one line.

8.  For its answers[] line, enter the answer between the quote marks 
      (replacing what is already there.)  Keep everything on one line.

9.  Delete any extra pairs you don't need, or add extra ones as needed.
      (Use the editor's cut, copy, and paste to make this easy.)
      Number added cards following the pattern of the first ones. 

10. Change the line var numCards  = N to the number of cards you now have.
      (Example: if you have 10 cards, they will be numbered 0 to 9 and
      var NumCards = 10)

11. Save the file.  Use a file name like "flashCards.html"  .

12. Use the flash cards by clicking on the file name, or by opening them in
    your browser.
