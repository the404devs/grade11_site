<p>
An on/off switch is simple
and easy to build.
An on/off switch moves two pieces of metal
together or moves them apart.
A light dimmer must gradually and smoothly
change the current that reaches the light.
It has more components that an on/off switch and
must be carefully assembled.
An accurate dimmer (where 25% means <em>exactly</em> 25%)
is even harder to build.
</p>

<p>
The same is true for the tiny devices inside of a silicon
chip.
On/off switches are relatively easy to fabricate.
<em>Easy to build</em> means that the devices are cheap, small, and
reliable, and  millions of them can be put in a small area.
