<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
ON.  The analog signal 
(continuously changing voltage signal)
moves up and down, 
but at time "T2" it is clear that it is above the threshold.
Exact measurement is not needed.

<p>
Analog signals 
continuously change in value.
By using a threshold, 
analog signals can represent binary data ("on/off" data).
It is easy and fast (for electronics, as well as for humans)
to determine if a voltage is above  or below a threshold.
The figure shows a signal that
transmits  "off" then "on".
(The signal is examined at times T1 and T2.)

<p>
Is is clear that the signal is "off" at time T1
and "on" at time T2?
