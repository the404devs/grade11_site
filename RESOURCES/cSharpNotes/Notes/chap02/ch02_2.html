<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
Because it shows time using definite digits,
rather than positions of hands that have to be measured.
(It would be less correct to say "because it has a computer inside.")

<h1>Binary</h1>

<A NAME="binary"></A>
<p>
<b>Binary</b> means "two states."
The two states are sometimes called "1" and "0",
or called "true" and "false",
or called "on" and "off",
(or other names.)
The essential characteristic is that a single
binary device can be in just one of two possible
states.
</p>

<A NAME="bit"></A>

<p>
A <b>bit</b> is a single "on/off" value.
</p>

<A NAME="toggle switch"></A>
<p>
A good example is a toggle switch, 
such as a light switch.
You can turn it "on" or "off" but not
(in normal operation) anything else.
A light switch holds one bit of information.
</p>

<p>
A light dimmer is not a binary device: it has
many positions between "off" and "fully on".
If you want a light dimmer in to be set to 25%,
you must carefully adjust it.
