Of course. Any type of symbol at all can be assigned
a binary pattern to represent it.

<h1>More on Representing Anything in Binary</h1>
<p>
Japanese and Chinese characters, also,
have been translated into bit patterns, 
and computers can manipulate those
symbols just as easily as ASCII.
Unicode is an agreement 
created by an international committee
on how to represent
characters using 16 bits.
Here are 16 bits 111110011111110
and here is the character it represents in Unicode:

<p>
Say that the international committee decides to represent
a new Chinese character.
How can they do this?
Easy:  they find a bit pattern not yet used to represent any
symbol and assign the new character to that pattern.
</p>

<p>
The correspondence between human language symbols and bit
patterns is arbitrary.
All you have to do is be sure that you are using enough
bits so that all the symbols of the language have a unique
bit pattern to represent them.
