<p>
Everyone knows that computers are "digital" 
and that they use "binary" numbers.
You probably have some idea of 
what these terms mean.
But we need to be clear about their precise meaning
and to be clear about why computers <i>are</i> digital.
</p>


<h4>Chapter Topics:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Binary signals. </li>
<li>Analog signals. </li>
<li>Advantages of Binary. </li>
<li>Bits. </li>
<li>Noisy signals. </li>
</ul>

<p>
Study these topics carefully if
you want to know what is really going on with computers.
