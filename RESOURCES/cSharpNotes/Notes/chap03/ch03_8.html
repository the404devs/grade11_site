<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Each byte of main memory has a unique address. &nbsp; <span style="size:+2;color:green">Yes</span></li>
<li>If main memory is 4 megabytes large, there will be 4 * 2<sup>20</sup> addresses. &nbsp; <span style="size:+2;color:green">Yes</span></li>

<p>
Main memory (as all computer memory) stores bit patterns.
That is,
each memory location consists of eight bits,
and each bit is either "0" or "1".
For example,
the picture shows the first few bytes of memory.
</p>

<A NAME="memory contents"></A>
<p>
The <em>only</em> thing that can be stored at one memory location
is eight bits, each with a value of "0" or "1".
The bits at a memory location are called the <em>contents</em> of that location.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes people will say that each memory location  holds an eight bit binary number.
This is OK,
as long as you remember that the "number" might be used to represent a character, 
or anything else.
</p>

<p>
Remember that what a particular pattern represents depends on its context
(ie., how a program is using it.)
You cannot look at an arbitrary bit pattern (such as those in the picture)
and say what it represents.
