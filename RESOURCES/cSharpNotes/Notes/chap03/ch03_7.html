<p>
Locations in a digital image are specified by a row number and a  column number
(both of them integers).
A particular digital image is 1024 rows by 1024 columns, and each location holds
one byte.
How many megabytes are in that image?
</p>

<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
1024&nbsp; * &nbsp;1024&nbsp; = &nbsp; 2<sup>10</sup>&nbsp; * &nbsp; 2<sup>10</sup>
&nbsp; = &nbsp; 2<sup>(10+10)</sup>&nbsp; = &nbsp; 2<sup>20</sup>&nbsp; = &nbsp;one megabyte

<p>
Main memory consists of a very long list of bytes.
In most modern computers,
each byte has an <em>address</em> that is used to locate it.
The picture shows a small part of main memory:
</p>

<p>
Each box in this picture represents a single byte.
Each byte has an address.
In this picture the addresses are the integers to
the left of the boxes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... and so on.
The addresses for most computer memory start at 0
and go up in sequence until each byte has an address.
</p>

<p>
Each byte contains a pattern of eight bits.
When the computer's power is on, 
every byte contains some pattern or other,
even those bytes not being used for anything.
(Remember the nature of binary: when a binary device 
is working it is either "on" or "off", never inbetween.)
</p>

<p>
The address of a byte is not part of its contents.
When the processor needs to access the byte at a
particular address, the electronics of the
computer "knows how" to find that byte in memory.

Decide which of the following are true:
</p>

<li>Each byte of main memory has a unique address.</li>
<li>If main memory is 4 megabytes large, there will be 4 * 2<sup>20</sup> addresses.</li>
