<h1>Bit</h1>
<A NAME="memory types"></A>
<p>
In both main and secondary memory,
information is stored as patterns of bits.
Recall from chapter two what a bit is:
</p>
<A NAME="bit"></A>

<blockquote>
A <b>bit</b> is a single <em>on/off</em> value.
Only these two values are possible.
</blockquote>


<p>
The two values may go by different names, such as <em>true/false</em>, or <em>1/0</em>.
There are many ways in which a bit can be <em>implemented</em>.
For example a bit could be implemented as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A mechanical electrical switch (like a light switch.)</li>
<li>Voltage on a wire.</li>
<li>A single transistor (used in main memory).</li>
<li>A tiny part of the surface of a magnetic disk.</li>
<li>A tiny part of the surface of a magnetic tape.</li>
<li>A hole punched in a card.</li>
<li>A tiny part of the light-reflecting surface of a CD.</li>
<li>Part of a radio signal.</li>
<li>Many, many more ways</li>
</ul>

<p>
So the particular implementation of bits is different
in main memory and secondary memory,
but logically, both types of memory store bits.

<h3> QUESTION 3:</h3>
<a href="ch03_4.html">
<img src="../nextBut.gif" hspace="5" align="right" border="0"/></a>
<p>
(Thought question:) Does the <em>information</em> change when
a bit is copied from one form of storage to another?
For example, does the information change when a bit 
implemented as a voltage level on a wire 
is copied to a tiny part of a disk?
