			<u> About Me </u>
		</h2>
		<p> 
			My name is Owen, and I am, in the simplest terms, a nerd. I enjoy reading sci-fi and fantasy novels, as well as anything tech-related. I'm also a pretty decent artist, and I should probably put an example here to prove that but I've probably long since forgotten to do that.
		</p>
		<p>
		My favourite novels are <i>Heir to the Empire</i> by Timothy Zahn (1991), and <i> Foundation</i> by Isaac Asimov (1951).
